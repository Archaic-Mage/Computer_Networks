## Experience

The assignment gave me a general understanding on how DNS server works. It also made me understand how the name to IP address translation works.

Working with several servers on a small scale, helped me realize how much large scale server networks has to be build to connect the whole world. The complications in storing ip records and accessing them on such a large scales takes time.

The algorithm build to operate on these levels of servers was also clear to us.

## Suggestions

- We can further extend the alogrithm to build a caching system, which could remember which server's name we requested for and save time.
- We could a domain registration system model, where we will have to provide the ads record data as a file and the program could just add a ADS server in the DNS network.

The assignment on whole was very interesting and fun to implement.
