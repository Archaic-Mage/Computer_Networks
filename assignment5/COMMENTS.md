## Introduction

The purpose of this report is to document my experience while working on the implementation of a small-scale Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) model. The project aimed to demonstrate the concept of OSPF routing protocol and provide hands-on experience to understand how it works in a real-world scenario.

## Challenges

During the implementation, I faced several challenges, including configuring the OSPF parameters and verifying the OSPF operation.Additionally, the simulation environment had limitations, and some features were not available, which made the implementation challenging.


## Lessons Learned

The project provided me with valuable insights into OSPF routing protocol and its implementation. I learned how OSPF works, including the concept of areas, routing table entries, and path selection. Additionally, the project taught me the importance of proper configuration and verification of OSPF parameters for successful operation.

## Conclusion

The implementation of a small-scale OSPF model was an enriching experience that provided me with hands-on experience in configuring OSPF routing protocol. The project allowed me to understand how OSPF works in a real-world scenario and the challenges associated with its implementation. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience that has enhanced my knowledge and skills in networking.
